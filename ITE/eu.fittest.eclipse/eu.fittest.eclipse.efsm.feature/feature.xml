      This feature includes EFSM (Testability-Transformation-Based Test Generation) that helps generating 
tests from logs using:

2) Model transformation to code for test generation
3) Use branch coverage test generation (EVOSUITE) to generate tests to cover the transformed model
4) Transform evosuite tests to target executable tests
