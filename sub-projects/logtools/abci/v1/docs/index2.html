<h2>ActionScript</h2>

ActionScript (AS) is a programming language to write browser-based
programs. To run an AS program you need an AS virtual machine
(VM). The popular Adobe's Flash Player has such a VM built in; the
player is in turn supported by many popular web browsers. Effectively,
this means that AS programs can be run in most browsers. Flash is not
the only AS VM in the market; there are few others, though Flash is
the most popular one. Also, in principle an AS program does not need
to be run on a browser. For example, a stand alone Flash player can be
used to run it. However if the program makes use of typical browser
features, e.g. interaction with Javascript fragments then a browser
would be needed. Also, if the AS program uses typical Adobe's GUI
libraries, then we may need Flash to run it, since Flash contains
those libraries as part of its run-time modules.


<p>An AS program is first compiled into bytecode, and then run on a
virtual machine. AS is an OO language, and is a dialect of
ECMAScript. So, its syntax and concepts are quite similar to
JavaScript. The original AS1 is dynamically typed, and uses the
prototype-based inheritence. AS2 adds static typing (along side
dynamic typing), and extends the syntax to make it appears to be a
class-based inheritence langauge. It is still a proto-type based
though. The current version is AS3, which features among other things
true class-based inheritence (beter performance), along side
proto-type based.


<h2>ABCI</h2>

ABCI is at the moment just a small number of instrumentation tools,
and a large instrumentation-related library, though the later is not a
really a library in the traditional sense. 

<p>A large part of ABCI is written using an Aspect Oriented framework
called Attribute Grammar (AG) developed by Utrecht
University. Using AG means that we also use the functional language
Haskell to specify a large part of our AG aspects. Additionally, there
are also parts of ABCI which are written in pure Haskell.

<p>The heart of ABCI is a library called <a
href="asil.html">ActionScript Instrumentation Library (ASIL)</a>. It
is a collection of pure Haskell modules and AG aspects. In principle,
a custom instrumentation tool can be built by composing them, but
doing this requires sufficient background in AG and Haskell.

<p>For ActionScript developers, ABCI provides a tool called abciLog,
which is used to inject logging code into a target ActionScript
program.

<p>For ABCI developers, ABCI also provides a tool called abciExample,
which is used as an example of how to make a custom instrumentation
tool using ASIL.

<p>Here is the official documentation of <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/documentation.html">AS3
compilers.</a> This documentation is actually of so-called Adobe's
Flex, which is a framework to build enterprise applications with
AS. Among other things, it allows the GUI front-end of an application
to be specified in so-called mxml code, which is a mix of XML and AS
code. You probably do not need most of the chapters in the
documentation; in any case Flex includes two compilers: component
compiler called compc, and application compiler mxmlc. Both can be
used to compile .as and .mxml. A "component" here means a set of
compiled classes and resources zipped together.

<p>The compiler section can be found under "Using Flex 4.x/Developer
tools".

<p>The URL above is for Flex 4.6; documentations of older versions of
Flex exist somewhere in Adobe's site; try to google for it.
