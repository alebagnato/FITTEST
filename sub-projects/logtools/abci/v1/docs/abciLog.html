<h1>ABCI Tool: abciLog</h1>

<p>This tool injects logging code to a target AS bytecode file
(swf or swc). The injection injects calls to log-functions provided by the
so-called FITTEST logging library.

<h2>Usage</h2>

For general usage, <a href="abciTool.html">see here</a>. Most of the
options are for auxilliary functionalities, such as to print
statistics and to produce the textual (human-readable) version of the
input bytecode file.

<p>Importantly, it is the -i option is the one that will inject
logging code. 

<p>To do the injection we additionally require "logging
specifications" to be provided in a file; this file is specified by
this option:

<p><ul>

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --log-points-spec-file=file  </tt>

<p>Example:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
abciLog -o hellowInj.swf -i --log-points-spec-file=InjectionSpec.txt hellow.swf
</blockquote>

<p>The above will inject on the file hellow.swf, and will save the
result as hellowInj.swf. The injection is specified by the file
InjectionSpec.txt.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --save-cfg=file  </tt>

<p>When you inject block-level logging (this will log instructions-blocks 
of some target methods), the block-ids will be logged whenever the corresponding
blocks are entered. To abstractly visualize where the blocks are, we can view
the control flow graphs (CFGs) of the corresponding methods. The above option will
save the CFGs in the speficied file. Note CFGs are of the input swf, not of the
resulting swf. This should be consistent with the injected block-ids in the logging
statements. The resulting swf may have its block-ids renumbered after the injection,
so these may be inconsistent with the injected ids.

<p>The CFGs are saved in two files: .txt and .dot. The first produces a representation
that can be directly re-read by the corresponding Haskell data type. The second is 
produces a representation in the DOT format, which you can visualize using a DOT tool.
E.g use Graphiz, or online using <a href=http://rise4fun.com/agl>AGL</a>. Just copy
the DOT specification of the method you want to visualize, and past it to the console
of these tools.



</ul>



<h2>Logging Specifications</h2>

<p>Imagine the target swf/swc file to consists of so-called
<i>joint-point</i>. Logging code can be injected at a joint-point. At
the moment, abciLog only provides two types of joint-point:

<ol>
<li>Method; or more generally: function.
<li>Block. The body of every function is made of 'blocks'. Every block is a maximal sequence of instructions that contains no jump, except its last instruction. No instruction in a block, except the first one, is a target of a jump from the same or another block.
</ol>

<p>A target program will have many joint-points inside it; we do not
typically want to log them all. A log specification file is needed to
specify which joint-points needed to be instrumented, and what kind of
logging are to be injected on them. Such a file contains a list of
specifications, the syntax is as follow:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<i>specification</i> ::= list of <i>specification</i>s // one line for each each <i>specification</i> 
</blockquote>

<p>If the specification file contains no specification, then nothing
will be injected.

<p>Each specification is a pair of this:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<i>specification</i> ::= <i>clause</i> <tt>:&gt-&gt:</tt> <i>injection-type</i>
</blockquote>

The injection type specifies what kind of logging code will be injected, and a clause is a filter on joint-points. There are three injection types, they can only be matched on joint-point on certain types:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<i>injection-type</i> ::= 
   <tt>LogFunc</tt> | 
   <tt>LogBlock</tt> |
   <tt>LogField</tt> "<i>Idpattern</i>" <i>fields</i>
</blockquote>

Example:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre>
[CNis "MyApp", FNhasPrefix  "update"] :>->: LogFunc
[CNis "MyApp", FNhasPrefix  "update"] :>->: LogBlock
[CNis "Score", FNis "Score"] :>->: LogField "Score" ["score", "hitCnt"]
</pre>
</blockquote>

The meaning is as follows. 

<ol> 

<p><li> C <tt>:&gt-&gt: LogFunc</tt> 

<p>This will match any function-joint-point f, provided the clause C
matches on f. When we have such a match, then any entry to and return
from f will be logged.

<p><li> C <tt>:&gt-&gt: LogBlock</tt> 

<p>This will macth any block-joint-point b, provided the clause C
matches on b. When we have such a match, then any entry to b will be
logged.

<p><li> C <tt>:&gt-&gt: LogField</tt> idp fs 

<p>This will match any function-joint-point f, provided C matches with
f. When we have such a match, whenever f is called on a target object
o (so it is a call like o.f(...)), this will cause o to be registered
as being part of the 'application state'. Normally, we use it on f's
which are constructors. For example when f is the constructor of a
class C, then the creation of every new instance of C will trigger the
registration of this instance.

<p>If there are multiple <tt>LogField</tt> specifications that match
the same f, only the first one will be applied.

<p>Such a registration does not in itself trigger any logging; but it
can. This is a specific feature of the FITTEST logger. The FITTEST
logger can be used to log so-called top-level application events. When
such an event occurs, the logger also log the current application
state. Since it is not realistic to serialize the actual application
state, it serializes an abstract representation of that instead. But
of course it has to know how to construct this abstract
representation.

<p>One way to do this is to let the developer to add a function in the
application that will do the job, and then somehow pass a pointer of
this function to the logger. However, the FITTEST logger also has a
facility to let the application register objects to be made part of
this abstract state. When asked to log the state, the logger then
simply serialize all registered objects in it. The logger will only
serialize o's fields which are specified in the parameter fs in the
above specification.

<p>The syntax for fields parameter is:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<i>fields</i> :=  [ zero or more <i>fieldName</i>s separated by , ]

<p><i>fieldName</i> := "<i>string</i> "
</blockquote>

<p>To allow registration, the object o must satisfy a number of things:

    <ol>

    <p><li>It must have a string ID. This ID has to be available from
    a public getter named <tt>automationName</tt>. This ID will be
    matches against the parameter idp in the above specification. It
    matches if it contains idp as its segment. 

   <p>Only if an ID can be obtained, and it matches then o will be
   registered.

   <p><li>Every field name f listed in the parameter fs must be either
   a public field or it (f) is a public getter.
   
    <p><li>The registered fields must be of primitive types
   (e.g. int,string), or an instance of the
   eu.fittest.Logging.ISerialization.Serializable
   interface. Trying to serialize an object that does not implement
   the interface will not cause the FITTEST logger to crash, but it
   will just write ?? in the log to indicate that it does not know how
   to serialize an object.

    </ol>

    <p>The IDs are assumed to be unique. If we try to register o whose
    ID is already registered by another object n, then n will be
    unregistered.


</ol>

The syntax of the clause C is as follows:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<i>clause</i> ::= [ zero or more <i>filter</i> separated by , ]

<p><i>filter</i> ::=  <tt>ALL </tt>
      <br>     |  <tt>FNis</tt>        "<i>string</i>"
      <br>     |  <tt>FNhasPrefix</tt> "<i>string</i>"
      <br>     |  <tt>FNhasSuffix</tt> "<i>string</i>"
      <br>     |  <tt>FNcontains</tt>  "<i>string</i>"
      <br>     |  <tt>CNis</tt>        "<i>string</i>"
      <br>     |  <tt>CNhasPrefix</tt> "<i>string</i>"
      <br>     |  <tt>CNhasSuffix</tt> "<i>string</i>"
      <br>     |  <tt>CNcontains</tt>  "<i>string</i>"
</blockquote>

Let p be a joint-point located in a class c and method f. A clause C
matches on p if all filters in C match on p.

<p>The ALL filter always matches on p. The filter FNis g matches on p
if f=g. The filter CNis d matches on p if c=d. The meaning of the
other filters are analogous.

Let us now consider the previous example again:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre>
[CNis "MyApp", FNhasPrefix  "update"] :>->: LogFunc
[CNis "MyApp", FNhasPrefix  "update"] :>->: LogBlock
[CNis "Score", FNis "Score"] :>->: LogField "Score" ["score", "hitCnt"]
</pre>
</blockquote>

This will cause function and block logging to be injected on all
methods of the class MyApp, whose name start with "update". It will
also register the fields score ad hitCnt of every instance of the
class Score, but only if the ID of this instance has the pattern
*Score*.

<h2>The Interface to the Logger</h2>


The injected code call the following functions from the FITTEST
logging library. The library is written in AS and is usually compiled
as a separate swc component.

<ol>
<p><li>From the class <tt>eu.fittest.Logging::FittestLogger</tt>:


   <ol>
   <p><li><tt class="OPTION">static public function getFittestLogger() : FittestLogger</tt>

   <p>This returns an instance of the logger.

   <p><li> 
<pre class="OPTION">
public function logLFunEntry ( 
	level:int,
	fname:Object, 
	fclassName:Object, 
	ftarget:Object,  
	...args) : void 
</pre>

   <p>This is used to log the entry to a function.

   <p><li> 
<pre class="OPTION">
