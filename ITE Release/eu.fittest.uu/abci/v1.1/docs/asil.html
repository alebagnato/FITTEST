<h2> Parser</h2>

<h3><a href="../lib/src/Parser.hs">Parser.hs</a></h3>

<p>The top-level parser is parseAnyAsSwf 

<pre  class="PROGRAMLISTING">
parseAnyAsSwf :: FilePath -&gt IO SwfFile
</pre>

It parses a given swc or swf file and returns an AST representing the
structure of the input.  Relevant modules:

    <ul>
    <li>The input file is read as a byte string. The underlying byte
    strings processing uses Data.Binary.Get.

    <li><a href="../lib/src/Parser.hs">ParseUtil.hs</a> provides underlying parsr combinators.
    
    <li><a href="../lib/src/ByteCodeAst.ag"> ByteCodeAst.ag </a>
    defines the data type representing ASTs of swfs. To use this ag
    file from Haskell, use its wrapper <a
    href="../lib/src/ByteCode.ag"> ByteCode.ag </a>.

    </ul>



<h2> Pretty Printer </h2>

<h3><a href="../lib/src/PrettyTree.ag">PrettyTree.ag</a></h3>

<p>The top level functions are:

<pre  class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ppSwf :: Options -> [SymbolTables] -> MethodDefInfos -> SwfFile -> Doc
ppAbc :: Options -> [SymbolTables] -> MethodDefInfo  -> AbcFile -> Doc
</pre>


<h2> Instrumentation </h2>

This functionality is used to inject additional code. It does not in
principle change existing code, though we can insert jumps that skip
some parts of the old code.

<p>The code that is to be injected is represented by the type Inj
defined in <a href="../lib/src/ByteCodeTrfDSL.hs"> ByteCodeTrfDSL.hs
</a>; the module also provides a DSL for constructing Injs. To
actually inject an Inj, it is first wrapped as the type InjHere or
InjHereAppend defined in <a href="../lib/src/ByteCodeTrfAst.ag">
ByteCodeTrfAst.ag. </a>; they allows us to specify whether the Inj is to
be injected before or after the injection point.

<p>Suppose we want to build a tool that can inject some logging code
at the beginning of AS functions. To specify (the core part of) such a
tool in AG, we weave an aspect over the start points of
functions. This aspect will define an inherited attribute for those
start points, and this attribute will be of the type InjHere. In the
semantic of this aspect we will have to define how it decides which
functions exactly are to be injected, and what Inj exactly is to be
injected.

<p>Note that an Inj carries an AS fragment. Injecting it may require
non trivial preparation. E.g. to inject an assignment x += 999 we also
need to add 999 to the constant pool. For this reason we made
injections to be specified as Higher Order attributes of the target
injection points. This allows their preparation to be specified using
the AG system as well.

<p>Example:

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
--
-- injecting a call to a logger at function entries
--
SEM Instruction | Virtual     -- part of the AST of the target swf
  inst.inj1 : InjHereAppend   -- injection is attached as a higher order attribute
  inst.inj1 = InjHereAppend_Inj
  inj1.code = when (@kind.self == VirtKind_BeginBody) $ do 
     mname     <- getMethodName
     cname <- getClassName                
     when (toBeIncluded some_selection_criterion mname cname) 
           $ 
           logFunEnter mname cname
           --
           -- logFunEnter is a help function to construct the
           -- series of AS instructions that will actually 
           -- call the logger and pass the needed parameters.
</pre>

<h2> Support modules</h2>

<h3><a href="../lib/src/ByteCodeTrfDSL.hs">ByteCodeTrfDSL.hs</a></h3>

<p>Contain functions to query the context of joint-points.

<p>Contain handy functions representing blocks bytecode instructions. 


<h3><a href="../lib/src/LogPointsLib.hs">LogPointsLib.hs</a></h3>

<p>Defining DSL to abstractly specify which log-points are to be
actually logged.


<h2> Aspects </h2>

<h3><a href="../lib/src/PrettyTree.ag">PrettyTree.ag</a></h3>

This is where the textual pretty-printer is defined.

<p>TO DO: make BEGIN BLOCK to also print block ID. Block ID is updated in <a href="../lib/src/ByteCodeTrfBase.ag">ByteCodeTrfBase.ag</a>
