<h1>FlashLogger (1.3) Advanced Use</h1>


<br>
<h2><a href="../asdocs/index.html">ActionScript Doc of the Classes</a></h2>


<br>
<h2><a name="JSAPIS">JavaScript APIs</a></h2>

If you deploy the logger as described in the <a href="usage.html">Customizing, Deploying, and Using the Logger</a> 
document, the class LoggerHook will also export a number of functions to query and control the logger
to the JavaScript level. These functions can be seen as APIs which can be used e.g. to retrieve the log
directly from the browser. The simplest use of these functions is by calling them directly from the browser's JavaScript
console. But of course it is also possible to call them programmatically from a separate JavaScript script.

<p>The APIs are listed below. They are all accessible as subelements of the element "AutomationLoader". If the 
application has been deployed accordingly as pointed above, this element "AutomationLoader" will be a direct child of the root document of the HTML page that contains the application. So, for example, to call an API named foo(), we can call it
as follows from e.g. the JavaScript console:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint">
document["AutomationLoader"].foo()
</pre>
</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>
<h4><tt>Invoke(targetid:String, eventtype:String, ...arg:String)</tt></h4>

Used to invoke an event programmatically, which can be useful e.g. for debugging. The above will 
invoke an event of type <tt>eventtype</tt> (e.g. "click") targeting a GUI-element (e.g. a button) of the 
specified id. If the event expect one more arguments, specify them in the arg.

<h4><tt>InvokeAndheck(targetid:String, etype:Strig, ...arg:String) : String</tt></h4>

As Invoke, but it returns a verdict string: "OK" if the event can be invoked without <i>directly</i> throwing an exception.
It returns an "ERROR:..." if the event throws an excpetion, e.g. indicating that the targeted GUI-element or the event-type 
do not exist. Note that exception thrown by a handler of the event cannot be detected
in this way; another mechanism needs to be invoked to detect it (see below).


<h4><tt>TestObject(targetid:String) : Boolean</tt></h4>

Used to check if there exists a GUI-element in the current state of the application, with the specified id.
If such an element exists, the function returns true; else false:


<h4><tt>GetUException() : String</tt></h4>

Used to checking if an exception has been thrown by some event handler. If this was the case, the function 
returnsa string reporting an exception that was thrown. Else the string is just "". Note that
this operation is not synchronous. That is, we have no way to know that all handlers have finished their execution.
So, the only way to make sure of this is to just wait long enough.

<h4><tt>getAbsState() : String</tt></h4>  

Used to query the application's current state, serialized in a string in the raw FITTEST format. This only works if the logger
has defined a serialization delegte to serialize the application state. Even then, the serialized state is typically not
the application's full state, but usually an abstraction of it; this is defined in the serialization delegate we mentioned
above.

An example of a string returned by the function:

<blockquote>
<pre>
%&lt;S "O:AppAbstractState"
%&lt;P
%&lt;{ I=0:ID }%&gt;
%&lt;{ selectedProduct=8:int }%&gt; %&gt; %&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
  
<!--  
Do note that if after doing a high level event e you query the state like this, 
due to the asynchronous nature of Flash events model, there is no guanrantee that
the state you get will be exactly the same as the state sampled by the logger.  
-->
  
<h4><tt>replayLog(fname:String)</tt></h4>  

Used to replay a log stored in the file with specified name. The log has to be in the
FITTEST XML format, and contains only hight level events. 
Depending on the application, replaying a log may or may not reproduce the original execution,
e.g. due to non-determinism in the application.

<h4><tt>LoggerGetLevel() : int</tt></h4>  

Returns the current logging level.

<h4><tt>LoggerChangeLevel(k:int)</tt></h4>  

Used to change the logging level. Events whose logging-level is lower than the current level are
not logged. High level events (those events that correspond to user's interaction through the GUI,
e.g. clicking on a button) are of level 5. Low level events are for example calls to some internal
functions in the application. These are of level 3. Block visits are of level 1.

<p>Note that logging low level events require the
application to have been appropriately instrumented.

<h4><tt>LoggerIsStopped() : Boolean</tt></h4>  

Returns true if the logger is currently in the stopped-stated; else false. When in the stopped-state,
the logger will not log anything.

<h4><tt>LoggerStop()</tt></h4>  

Used to stop the logger.  When in the stopped, the logger will not log anything.

<h4><tt>LoggerResume()</tt></h4>  

Used to resume the logger; it will then start logging again.

<h4><tt>LoggerIsInternalCopyKept() : Boolean</tt></h4>  

Returns true if the logger is currently set to echo log entries to an internal buffer, else false. 
It is possible
to get the cotent of this buffer. In other words, we can get a copy of the log from JavaScript.

<h4><tt>LoggerEchoLogToInternalCopy(b : Boolean)</tt></h4>  

Used to set the logger so that it echos log entries to an internal buffer (if b is true), or otherwise
(if b is false).

<h4><tt>LoggerGetLog() : String</tt></h4>  
	
Used to get the content of the logger's internal buffer. In other words, this will return a copy of the log
so far.	

<h4><tt>LoggerClearBuffer()</tt></h4>  

Used to clear the logger's internal buffer.	

<h4><tt>LoggerReset()</tt></h4>  
	
Used to stop the logger, and to clear its internal buffer.

<h2>Writing Automation Delegates</h2>

When the FlashLogger is succesfully deployed along side the target Flash application, 
it will automatically intercepts user events and log them. The infrastructure for
facilitating this interception is actually provided by the class Automation from
the package eu.fittest.actionscript.automation. The actual interception is done by
so-called automation delegates. These are subclasses of the class Delegate from
the package eu.fittest.actionscript.automation. Automation maintains a dictionary
containing pairs (C,D) where C is a DisplayObject class, and D is the corresponding
delegate class. When Automation detects a new a DisplayObject o:C, it looks in this dictionary
for a matching delegate. If an entry (C,D) can be found, it will the constructor of D, passing o
to it: new D(o). This constructor will then register some one or more of its own handlers to
one or more event-types of o. Effectively, it specifies some interception logic on events of 
these types when they arrive on o.

<p>Currently we support delegates for Button, ButtonBar, Canvas, ComboBox, Image, Label, Slider,
TabNavigator, and TextField from the mx-family. If more types of delegates need to be added,
you can write one yourself. Here is an example of how we could write a delegate for mx.controls.Button;
it would have the following structure:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  public class ButtonDelegate extends Delegate {
    
    public function ButtonDelegate(button:Button) { 
       super(button); 	
       // specify here which events are to be intercepted:, e.g. click-event:
       ....
    }	

    // specify your interceptors, each just passing on the event to Automation:
    private function clickInterceptor(ev:Event):void {
       Automation.record(this, Command.create("click"));
    }
    				
    // we also need to specify how to replay an event:
    public function click():void {
       object.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent(MouseEvent.CLICK, true,false));
    }
             
    // specify how to construct a unique and stable ID; this is called
    // when Automation cannot get the automationName:
    protected override function automationId():String {
       return button.label; 
    }
  }
</pre>
</blockquote>

Once we write a delegate like this, we still need to add it to Automation's
dictionary of delegates, e.g.:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Automation.registerDelegateClass(mx.controls.ButtonBar, ButtonBarDelegate);
</pre>
</blockquote>

A good place to do this is e.g. in your own MyLogger.

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
package myownPackage{
  import flash.events.Event;
  import flash.events.MouseEvent;
  import flash.utils.*;
	
  import mx.controls.Button;
  import eu.fittest.actionscript.automation.ClickableDelegate;

  public class ButtonDelegate extends Delegate {
    
    public function ButtonDelegate(button:Button) { 
       super(button); 	
       // inserting the interceptor-function:
       object.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK,clickHandler, false, -10);
    }	

    // the interceptor:
    private function clickHandler(ev:Event):void {
       // just echo the event to Automation, the logger will hook there; the event will
       // be called "click"
       Automation.record(this, Command.create("click"));
    }
				
    // we also need to specify how to replay "click"
    public function click():void {
       object.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent(MouseEvent.CLICK, true,false));
    }
        
    // specify a way to construct a unique and stable ID, in case automationName is
    // not defined:
    protected override function automationId():String {
       var button:Button = object as Button;
       if (button.label) { return button.label; }
       else return "Button"+ ... // some unique number 	  
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Low Level Logging</h2>

It is also possible to log at the lower levels, namely at function-entry and function-exit, 
as well as at every block-entry within the function. However, to do this we need
to instrument the functions of interest. You can use the <b>abci</b> bytecode instrumenter to do this.
It allows you to specify which functions you want to log, and at what level (do you
want the blocks to be logged, or not), using expression such as:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint">
[CNis "MyApp", FNhasPrefix  "update"] :>->: LogFunc
</pre>
</blockquote>

The instrumenter will insert logging code that is compatible with this Flash logger. See its documentation.

<br>
<h2><a name="protocol">Protocol to Remotely control the Logger</a></h2>

Logs can be collected remotely through an agent. Out of the box, the FlashLogger assumes you use
the FITTEST agent to do this. In turn, the agent requires the FITTEST ITE. From the ITE you can
control the agents in various clients' machines, and thus controlling the loggers. This includes
retrieving logs from them. We describe below the protocol between the logger and the agent.
By re-implementing the protocol you can thus either have your own custom way to remotely retrives logs
(without having to use FITTEST agents nor ITE), or implement your own logger that can be controlled
from the ITE.

<p>Roughly, the protocol works as follows. The agent first open a socket at localhost:port. This 
port is assumed to be between 37600 and 37650. The logger scans this range. When it manages to
connect to the agent, some initialization exchanges follow. The agent then opens a new socket, 
dedicated for receiving log-entries from the logger; whereas the first socket is dedicated for
exchanging control messages. We will use the term <b>data socket</b> and <b>control socket</b>
to refer to them. The agent can now command the logger to start logging. From that point on,
strings that are to be logged will be send to the data socket. This goes on until the agent
command the logger to terminate logging; when this happen it can for example send the final log
to some remote address.

<p>The full protocol is described below.
