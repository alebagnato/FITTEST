# Introduction

SOAPMutation is an XML mutation tool that mutates XML input files to generate new XML files, 
each with a small change compared to the original XML files. Originally, SOAPMutation was
developed to mutation SOAP messages for Web Service testing. However, it can be used to 
mutate other XML files as well.

Two inputs are required:
* An original XML input file
* A constraint specification file, also in XML format

Constraints on the XML elements of the input file are specified using a format similar to XSD. 
The Schema for the constraint specification is under xsd/WSDLConstraints.xsd. There is 
an example file for EbayFindingAPI service in the same folder. More information about this
constraint specification language is available here:
