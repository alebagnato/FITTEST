<h1>ABCI tool: abciExample</h1>

<p>This is intended as an example of ABCI developers. It shows how an
instrumentation tool is composed from ASIL. This tool will inject a
call trace(...) at the beginning of every method, and just before
retun-instructions. In ActionScript, the function trace(s) will print
the string s into the Flash's log file. (You need to set up your Flash
to enable its logging; see its documentation)

<p>Usage:<a href="abciTool.html">see here</a>. The -i option will do
the trace(..) injection as mentioned above.

<p>The easiest way to alter abciExample is by changing the behavior of
-i. In other words, changing the behavior of its instrumentation
feature. All other functionalities such as statistics and pretty
printing will be inherited.
