<h1>ABCI Tools General Usage</h1>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
toolname options* targetfile
</blockquote>

The target file is an swf or swc file, containing ActionScript bytecode programs.

<h2>Options</h2>

Below, "ActionScript program" means the whole collection of
ActionScript classes conatained in the input swf/swc file. This program
is, of course, in bytecode.

<p><ul>

<li>  <tt class="OPTION"> -o filename  | --output=filename </tt>

<p>Specify the name of the output file (.swf or .swc).

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> -v | --verbose </tt>

<p>When set, this turns on verbose output.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --save-ast=filename </tt>

<p>When set, this will pretty print the bytecode content of the input
ActionScript program into the specified file. 

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --dump-sym </tt>

<p>When set, this will print a symbol table listing all the symbols in
the input ActionScript program to the stdout. The table is expressed
as a Haskell expression.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --dump-types </tt>

<p>When set, this will generate a graph showing the class structure of
the input ActionScript program. The graph is expressed in DOT, and is
printed to the stdout.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --gen-lib=name </tt>

<p>When set, will generate a (large) Haskell file containing
data-types that values that describe the structure of the input
ActionScript file. It creates Haskell types for each ActionScript
type, and Haskell identifiers for each field of a class.

The idea was that it provides a strongly typed interface to Haskell
towards the ActionScript program. 

<p><u>This functionality has become outdated</u>.


<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --gen-inh=filename </tt>

<p>When set, this will generate an ActionScript program containing a
dictionary describing the inheritence structure of the input swf file.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --gen-sym-lib=filename </tt>

<p>When set, it will generate an "swc library" that is a "stub" for
the input ActionScript program A. You can then use this stub for the
development of another program Lib so that in Lib you can refer to
things defined in A, without physically linking Lib to A. 

The rationale is that we want Lib to know the structure of A, but we
want it to link it with the instrumented version of A instead.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> -i | --instrument </tt>

<p>When set, will run "the instrumentation"; what this does is specific
to the particular ABCI-tool that is used; this should be described in
that tool's documentation. For example, the abciExample tool will
inject trace(..) at the beginning of every method, and before every
return-instructions.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --inject-abc=filename </tt>

<p>When set, this will insert the {.abc,.swf,.swc} file to the input
swc file.  An swf/swc file consists of blocks called 'tags'. A tag can
contain ActionScript code, but it can also contain other things, like
resources. The specified filename will be insterted after the last
code tag.


<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --inject-before </tt>

<p>When set, this will cause the swc-file specified with the
inject-abc option above to be inserted before the first code tag
(rather than after the last one). This may be needed for the following
reason. The Flash player loads code tags (tags containing code) one at
a time, and type-checks them in that order. So, if some code A refers
to a class defined in another code tag B, than B must occur earlier in
the swf/swc file.

<p>For example, suppose we want to isntrument a target application A
by injecting calls to custom log-functions. However, these
logs-functions are defined in a separate swc file Lib, which was not
compiled along with A (there was no reason to do so). This means that
in addition to the injection of the calls to the log-functions, we
also need to add Lib to A's swc file. And this Lib needs to be added
in the front.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --inject-refl  </tt>

<p>When set, this is supposed to inject additional information into
the input ActionScript program to facilitate reflection. <u>This feature
is not fully worked out</u>. ActionScript itself already supports some
degree of reflection.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --inject-serial  </tt>

<p>When set, this will add a serialization method for every class in
the input ActionScript program. This is used to facilitate the logging
of objects' states.  Based on the structure of each class, this
feature figures out which fields are to be included in the
serialization.  <u>This feature is not fully worked out</u>.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --env=list of files </tt>

<p>This has no function, and should be dropped.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> -s | --dump-stats </tt>

<p>When set, will print the statistics of the input swf/swc file.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> -c | --check </tt>

<p> When set, will check the some static consistency-properties of the
bycode programs in the input swf/swc file.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --prettylabs </tt>

<p>When set, this will include instruction labels to be printed as
well when we pretty-print the input swf/swc.

<!--
<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --config=file </tt>

<p>This option is not used and removed; may put it back in the future...:

<p>Will simply load the contents of the file as a ByteString. The
content can be anything, but it has to be in the utf8
format. Internally, this file is then passed around in the "options"
structure, in the field "optConfigs". An instrumentation tool can
query this field, but it has to decide by itself what it wants to do
with it. 
-->

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --export-sym=file </tt>

<p>When set, this will generate a .sym file containing type
information about the classes in the input ActionScript program. Such
.sym files can later be read in using the "--import-sym" option. You
can then query the structure of various classes with some of our
Haskell functions.

<p>These sym files are needed when you want to find out the structure
of types that are not defined by the flash file itself. E.g. the
classes from the runtime library.

<p>The directory /env contains some examples of .sym files.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --import-sym=file </tt>

<p>To read a .sym file, or files, or an entire directory of those.

<li> <tt class="OPTION"> --no-dead-code </tt>

<p>Dead code is by default removed. If set, this option will surpress
the removal of dead code (so, it is not removed).

</ul>


<h2>Example</h2>

Here is a simple <a href="Point.as">ActionScript class</a>. You need to first compile it to swf; e.g. using the command: mxmlc Point.as.

<p>Now we can use the tool abciExample on the resulting swf file. For example:

<blockquote  class="PROGRAMLISTING">
abciExample -s Point.swf
</blockquote>

will give you some statistic; something like:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre>
Stats {numTags = 10, tagNr = 0, numInstrs = 68, numClasses = 1, numProps = 4, numMethods = 4, numNames = 7}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 1, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 2, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 3, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 4, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 5, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 6, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 7, numInstrs = 68, numClasses = 1, numProps = 4, numMethods = 4, numNames = 7}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 8, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 9, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
Stats {numTags = 1, tagNr = 10, numInstrs = 0, numClasses = 0, numProps = 0, numMethods = 0, numNames = 0}
</pre>
</blockquote>

An swf file is made of blocks wich are called tags. You can see above
that Point.swf has 10 tags, and the bytecode of the class is put in
tag-7.

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
abciExample --dump-ast Point.swf
</blockquote>

will print a human-readable version of the bytecode; it looks like <a href="Point.abc.pp">this</a>.

<p>Suppose we now do:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
abciExample -i --output=InstrumentedPoint.swf Point.swf
</blockquote>

It will run the instrumentation on Point.swf, and will save the result
in InstrumentedPoint.swf. To textually view the result, run
abciExample --dump-ast on the result; we will something get <a
href="InstrumentedPoint.abc.pp">this</a>. Notice that this code
fragment is now inserted at the beginning of every method:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre>
INSTR Find property strict trace
INSTR Push string INFO: enter Point.isEqual
INSTR Call prop (void) trace args: 1
</pre>
</blockquote>

It corresponds to the call trace("INFO: enter Point.isEqual").


<h2>ABCI developers: what if I want to write my own instrumentation?</h2>

Unfortunately at the moment we do not have the time to write a proper
documentation about this; it requires a lot of explanation. For now,
this part is only making sense for internal use. Background in
Attribute Grammar is required.

<p>Below we show an example of how the instrumentation of this tool
was written in AG. This is defined in the file <txt class="FILENAME">lib/DemoInstrumentation2.ag</txt>.


<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre>
{
-- The top-level instrumentation function is composed as below.
--
exampleInjection :: Options -> [SymbolTables] -> SwfFile -> SwfFile
exampleInjection opts tbls inputSwf = injectedSwf where
  inh = Inh_SwfFile { opts_Inh_SwfFile = opts, tbls_Inh_SwfFile = tbls }
  transformer =  sem_SwfFile inputSwf
  syn         =  wrap_SwfFile transformer inh
  injectedSwf =  output_Syn_SwfFile syn
}

...

--
-- Instrumenting method's begin:
--
SEM Instruction | Virtual 
  inst.inj1 : InjHereAppend
  inst.inj1 = InjHereAppend_Inj
  inj1.code =  
     -- macth the start of each method's body
     when (@kind.self == VirtKind_BeginBody) $ do 
       mname     <- getMethodName
       className <- getClassName   
       -- check if it is the method that we want          
       when (isTarget className mname) $ myLog "enter" className mname 
                  
--
-- Instrumenting the "return" instruction
--         
SEM Instruction | ReturnValue                   
  inst.inj1 : InjHere
  inst.inj1 = InjHere_Inj
  inj1.mode = InjPrepend
  inj1.code = do 
                mname     <- getMethodName
                className <- getClassName                  
     when (isTarget className mname) $ myLog "exit" className mname 
                   
SEM Instruction | ReturnVoid                  
  inst.inj1 : InjHere
  inst.inj1 = InjHere_Inj
  inj1.mode = InjPrepend
  inj1.code = do 
     mname     <- getMethodName
     className <- getClassName                 
     when (isTarget className mname) $ myLog "exit" className mname 

</pre>
</blockquote>

You will have to build the corresponding Haskell file form the above
AG specification. The top-level function defined above is
exampleInjection. 

<p>In the demo-tool abciExample, we define a <a
href="../derivedtools/abciExample/src/Main.hs" class="FILENAME">Main.hs</a> Haskell
file. This main file uses the instrumentation specified in another
Haskell file, namely <a
href="../derivedtools/abciExample/src/Spec.hs" class="FILENAME">Spec.hs</a>. You can
see in the latter (Spec.hs), where the function exampleInjection
mentioned above is being hooked in.
