<h1>FlashLogger (1.3) <br> Customizing, Deploying, and Using the Logger </h1>

<br>
The FlashLogger allows user interactions with a Flash application to
be automatically logged. The standard use of the logger requires the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/fittest/wiki/FittestIte">FITTEST
Integrated Testing Environment (ITE)</a> to control it and to collect
the logs. Roughly, this ITE is an Eclipse integrated environment to
support automated testing of Internet applications. It uses the
FlashLogger to collect logs from remote Flash clients to infer
behavior models, and to ultimately generate test-cases from them.

<p>Check out the <a href="advanceduse.html">Advanced Use document</a> if you just
want to use the logger for your own purpose, without the ITE.

<p>The logger produces logs in the so-called FITTEST format. The
format is text-based, well defined and deeply structured
(e.g. allowing objects to be serialized into a log), but more compact
than e.g. XML. An example of a fragment of such a log is shown below;
it shows the state of some a Person object:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre  class="prettyprint">
%&lt;S "O:Person"
%&lt;P %&lt;{ I =0:ID }%&gt;
%&lt;{ name="Sponge Bob ":String }%&gt;
%&lt;{ age=4:int }%&gt;
%&lt;{ spouse=&gt; }%&gt; 
%&gt;
%&lt;S "O:Person"
  ... // here is the spouse object
%&gt;
%&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>


<div class="HIGHLIGHT">
The format is described in the <a
href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/repo/CS-2012/2012-014.pdf">
UU-CS-2012-014</a> technical report. To facilitate processing by other tools,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/fittest/wiki/HaslogSuite">Haslog-suite</a> can be used to convert the format to XML.
</div>

<p>The logger intercepts and logs user events (interactions), such as
when she clicks on a button, or when she changes the value of a
text-field. A flash application can be thought to consist of a set of
GUI components that the user can interact with. Note that this set is
often dynamic (a button can be added or removed at the run time). The
FlashLogger automatically detects when a GUI component is added, and
will then start monitoring it, so that the logger knows when the user
interacts with it, and thus able to log the corresponding event. Out
of the box, the logger supports automatic monitoring of a subset of
the mx-family GUI components. See the <a href="advanceduse.html">Advanced Use
document</a> for information on how to extend this subset.

<p>Whenever a user event is logged, the logger also writes the state of
the application into the log. It does not of course dumps the actual
concrete state, because it is usually very large. Instead, an abstract
summary of the state is written. However, the logger does not know how
to construct such a summary. If we do not specify it, it will just log
the name of the application as the summary. Additionally, when an
event is logged, e.g. a click on a button, it is useful to know which
GUI component is targetted by the event, e.g. when there are more that
one button, we want to know which button the user has
clicked. Although the programmer may assign a label to a button, such
as "submit", such a label is not a reliable indentifier: there could
be another button with the same label. The logger relies instead on
the field "automationName", which any subclass of mx.core.UIComponent
has. This field is intended to contain a unique identifier. However,
specifying it is not compulsory. If it is absent, the logger will try
to construct an identifier, though such automatically constructed
identifier is not guaranteed to be stable over multiple runs of the
same application.

<p>Every user event will then generate an entry such as the one below in
the log:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre  class="prettyprint">
%&lt;S -120:1375179109077 "E"   // time stamp
%&lt;S "O:eu.fittest.actionscript.automation::RecordEvent"
%&lt;P
%&lt;{ I=0:ID }%&gt;
%&lt;{ targetID="ID_addItem":String }%&gt;  // the identifier of the GUI component
%&lt;{ type="click":String }%&gt;  // the type of the event
%&lt;{ args=&gt; }%&gt; // an array of the arguments of the event, if any
%&gt;
%&lt;S "O:Array"  
%&lt;P
%&lt;{ I=1:ID }%&gt;
%&gt;
%&gt;
%&gt;
%&lt;S "O:AppAbstractState" // an object representing the application's state
%&lt;P
%&lt;{ I=2:ID }%&gt;
%&lt;{ numOfSelectedItems=10:int }%&gt;
%&lt;{ numInBuyCart=1:int }%&gt;
%&gt;
%&gt;
%&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Other than specifying automation-names of relevant GUI components,
the logger does not need anything to be programmed in the application
itself. In fact, the flash application can pretend to be completely
unaware of the logger. We do need to alter the deployment script of
the application. We will use a separate loader to load both the
application and the logger. The logger will then attach itself to the
application, and from that point on it can start to log. The logger
can be controlled from the client's browser, through a set of
JavaScript APIs. This includes the ability to collect the log
<b>locally</b>. However, to control and collect the logs <b>remotely</b> will
require the FITTEST ITE and its agents to be deployed as well --we
will explain more about this later.


<p>
<div class="HIGHLIGHT">
So, roughly the steps required to use the logger are these:

<ol>
<li>Assign automation-names.
<li>Specify how to serialize the application's state. 
<li>Deploy the FITTEST ITE and its agents.
<li>Deploy the Flash application along with the logger.
<li>Retrieve the log.
</ol>

These are explained below. There is also an example provided along with the distribution.
</div>

<p>
<div class="HIGHLIGHT">
Information on more advanced use of the logger is provided in the <a href="advanceduse.html">Advanced Use document</a>.
</div>

<br>
<h2>Assigning automation-names</h2>

Every GUI component in a Flash application is typically an instance of
a sub-class of mx.controls.UIComponent. As such, it inherits a String
field called automationName which the logger uses as the component's
identifier. This name will be visible in the log, as the field
targetID in the log entries of events that target the component --see
also the example above. Knowing this identifier allows us to locate
the component in the source code. If logs are used to construct a
behavior model of the application, which in turn is used to generate
test-cases, this identifier is also needed by the test driver in order
to find the component, and replay a event.

<p>AutomationName is however not automatically assigned, so the
programmer has to do this himself. Below is an example of how to do it
in mxml.

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;mx:VBox&gt;
   &lt;mx:Button automationName="ID_addItem" label="submit" click="handleAddItem(i)"/&gt;
   &lt;mx:Button automationName="ID_removeItem" label="cancel" click="handleRemoveItem(i)"/&gt;
&lt;/mx:VBox&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>Specifying How to Serialize the Application's State</h2>

As said before, we do not usually want write the entire state of the
application to the log. It is too big. To specify which part of the
state is to be logged, we need to write a subclass of the class
FittestLoggerHook of the package eu.fittest.Logging, which should be
exported by the component flashloggerLib.swc, which comes with the
logger distribution. There are two functions that we need to override:

<ol>
<li>
<h4><pre class="prettyprint">public function ignoreList(evt:RecordEvent) : Boolean</pre></h4>

This is used to specify (patterns of) events that we are not
interested in. They will not be logged. For example, clicks on static
text fields usually do not trigger any semantical behavior; and are
thus not so interesting to be logged.

<li>
<h4><pre class="prettyprint">public function registerSerializationDelegates() : void</pre></h4>

This is used to specify how instances of some classes are to be
serialized into the log; this includes specifying how to serialize the
application itself.

</ol>



<p>As an example let us write a class MyLogger that extends
FittestLoggerHook. The structure of this class will look as below. It
will need to import classes from the package eu.fittest.Logging,
eu.fittest.Logging.Serialization, and
eu.fittest.actionscript.automation which are provided by
flashloggerLib.swc and automation.swc.


<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
package {
  import eu.fittest.Logging.*;
  import eu.fittest.Logging.Serialization.*;
  import eu.fittest.actionscript.automation.*;
  ...
  public class MyLogger extends FittestLoggerHook {
  
    public function MyLogger() { super() ; }
	
    override public function ignoreList(evt:RecordEvent) : Boolean { 
      ... // specify which events to ignore, if any
    }

    override public function registerSerializationDelegates() : void {
        super.registerSerializationDelegates() ;
        ... // specify how to serialize the application, and other classes as needed
    }
  }	
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

As said, when an event is written to the log, the logger also writes
the current state of the application into the log. What actually
happens is that a pointer to the application is passed to the logger,
and the logger will then search for a proper function that knows how
to serialize the object pointed to by the pointer; the resulting
string is written to the log. Since an object may have fields pointing
to other objects, we may thus also need to specify how to serialize
these other objects, if we want them to be written to the log as
well. So, a more general question is: how to tell the logger how it can
serialize instances of a certain class C?

<br>
<h3>Specifying How to Serialize a Class</h3>

There are two ways to specify how instances of a class C are to be
serialized. The first is by making C to implement the interface
Serializable of eu.fittest.Logging.Serialization provided by
flashloggerLib.swc. See the example below:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
public class Product implements Serializable {
    
    public var name   : String ;
    public var price  : int ;
    public var date   : Date ;
    public var supplier : Suplier ;
    
    ...

    public function serializeSelf(s : Serializer) : void {
        s.beginObject(this,"Product") ;
        s.storeField("name",name) ;
        s.storeField("price",price) ;
        s.storeField("supplier",supplier) ;
        s.endObject() ;
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

If a pointer to a Product is passed to the logger, it will
automatically call the serializeSelf function. As defined above, it
will log the name and price of the product, but not its date. It will
also log the product's supplier. However, since this is another
object, rather than a primitive value, the logger will then
recursively look for a function to serialieze it. If Supplier also
implements Serializable, the logger works in the same was as with
Person. If no serialization function is found, the logger will only
log the type of the object; since that is the only information it
can infer about it.

<p>The above approach is not really transparent, as it forces us to
write the serialization in the code of the class Person, and thus
forcing it to be aware of logging. A second way to specify
serialization is by specifying a special serialization-delegate for
Person. The logger maintains a table of such delegates. This table
contains entries of the form (C,f), where C is class name, and f is a
function that knows how to serialize instances of C. If we give an
object o of class C to the logger, to be serialized, and C does not
implement Serializable, the logger will search in this table of
delegates. If it finds a (C,f), then f is used to serialize o. Note
that f can be defined completely outside the definition of C. For
example, we can define it in MyLogger, e.g. as follows:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint">
function serializeProduct(p:Object, s : Serializer) : void {
        s.beginObject(p,"Product") ;
        s.storeField("name",p["name"]) ;
        s.storeField("price",p["price"]) ;
        s.storeField("supplier",p["supplier"]) ;
        s.endObject() ;
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Once defined, we then need to register it to the logger, to be added
into its table of delegates that we talked about above. This can be
done as follows:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint">
Delegates.registerDelegate(getDefinitionByName("Person") as Class, serializeProduct) ;  
</pre>
</blockquote>


<br>
<h3>MyLogger's Full Code</h3>

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
package {
  import eu.fittest.Logging.*;
  import eu.fittest.Logging.Serialization.*;
  import eu.fittest.actionscript.automation.*;
  import flash.utils.*;
  
  import mx.controls.*;
  import mx.core.*;
  import mx.containers.*;
	
  public class MyLogger extends FittestLoggerHook {
  
    public function MyLogger() { super() ; }
	
    override public function ignoreList(evt:RecordEvent) : Boolean {
        var o = evt.source.target ;
        if(o is mx.controls.Label) // e.g. we ignore clicks on labels
             return true ;
        else return false ;
    }

    override public function registerSerializationDelegates() : void {
        super.registerSerializationDelegates() ;
        Delegates.registerDelegate(getDefinitionByName("MyApplication") as Class, 
                                   seriaizeMyApp) ;  
    }
	
    private static function seriaizeMyApp(app:Object, s:Serializer) : void {
        var selectedItems : Array =  app["selected"] ;
        var buyCart : Array       =  app["buyCart"]  ;
        // the serialization begin here:
        s.beginObject(app,"AppAbstractState") ;
        s.storeField("numOfSelectedItems", selectedItems.length ) ;
        s.storeField("numInBuyCart", buyCart.length) ;
        s.endObject() ;
    }
  }	
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Then we compile it to build the logger, e.g. as below. We will need
to have the components flashloggerLib.swc and automation.swc in our
library-path (below it is ./libs).

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint">
mxmlc -library-path+=./libs -incremental=true -debug=true 
      -source-path . 
      -output logger.swf  
      -- MyLogger.as
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h2>Deploying the Application along with the Logger</h2>

The standard way to deploy a Flash application is by embedding it (an .swf file) 
in an HTML page, and to put them in a directory served by a web server.
When a user, through a browser, requests this page from the server, the page will also cause
the application to be downloaded, and loaded into the browser (assuming
that this browser has a Flash plugin).
For testing or debugging, this web server can of course be deployed locally,
in the same machine as where the tester runs a browse. We will assume the above 
way of deployment; but now we need to change the embedding script.

<p>Imagine we have a flash application which we have compiled into an
.swf file called "flexstore.swf. Imagine that this .swf is embedded in
an HTML file as shown by the code below. It is a quite typical way to
embed .swf, by using a bit of JavaScript and the <a
href="https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">swfobject</a> JavaScript library to
simplify the embedding. This HTML, along with the flexstore.swf and
the needed *.js, will be put in the web server.

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html linenums">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="swfobject.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     swfobject.embedSWF("flexstore.swf", "myFlashApp", "1000", "800", "9.0.0");
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="myFlashApp"&gt;
    If you don't see anything: ouch...fails to embed the flash-application.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

Now suppose we want to also log the application using the FlashLogger. 
Generally, the steps are as follows:

<ol>
<li> We need to build our own logger.swf.
<li> We need to adjust the above way of embedding .swf.
<li> We deploy the application at the server.
<li> We also need to deploy a FITTEST agent.
<li> User can now requests the embedding HTML.
</ol>

To do (1), we need to write myLogger.as and compile it to logger.swf,
as explained above.

<p>Rather than loading the application flexstore.swf directly as
above, we now need to load it indirectly. So, we need to
change the way flexstore.swf is embedded in its HTML (2). The new HTML is
shown below. Its script will first load a special loader called
AutomationLoader. This will setup the infrastructure to automatically
intercept events. Then, the loader proceeds with loading
flexstore.swf, and then logger.swf. It also loads so-called
automation-delegates --their role is described in the <a
href="advanceduse.html">Advanced Use document</a>.

<p>In addition to the new code below, we will also need to put all
FlashLogger's components in the web server:

   <blockquote>
   automation.swc
   <br>AutomationLoader.swf
   <br>flashloggerLib.swc
   <br>FlexDelegates.swf
   </blockquote>

, and of course logger.swf too.

<br>
<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

When the user requests the above HTML, it will now load the
application, and the logger will be running in the background.

<p>The log can be collected by the user in his client's machine
through the logger's <a href="advanceduse.html#JSAPIS">JavaScript APIs</a>. However, it
would be more sophisticated if we can collect logs from various users
remotely. As said, this requires the FITTEST ITE and its agents.  In
priciple it is possible to use a custom remote log-collector, namely
by implementing the agent's protocol. This is described the <a
href="advanceduse.html">Advanced Use document</a>.


<h3>Deploying FITTEST ITE and its Agents</h3>

The <a
href="https://code.google.com/p/fittest/wiki/FittestIte">FITTEST
Integrated Testing Environment (ITE)</a> is an Eclipse integrated
environment to facilitate automated testing of Internet
applications. It gather logs from the System Under Test (SUT), from
which it tries to infer behavior models and oracles of the current SUT
version. When the SUT is updated to its next version, the ITE can
generate test-cases from the models previously inferred. Logging is an
important part in this approach of testing; and the FlashLogger is
part of its work flow to remotely gather logs from Flash clients.

<p>The ITE does not actually control the loggers directly. It does so
through agents. In this way, the SUT does not have to be aware, nor to
care, where the ITE is hosted.

<p>So, if you want to collect the logs remotely, you also need to
deploy the ITE. Furthermore, the clients' users need to download and
deploy the client-side agents as well, prior to loading the client.

<p>Instructions on the deployment of the ITE and its agents can be
found in the <a href="???">ITE User Manual</a>, Section xxx.

<br>
<h2>Retrieveing the Log</h2>

To remotely retrieve the log, see <a href="???">ITE User
Manual</a>. To locally retrieve the log, you can use one of the
JavaScript APIs:

<blockquote class="PROGRAMLISTING">
<pre class="prettyprint">
document["AutomationLoader"].LoggerGetLog()
</pre>
</blockquote> 

<br>
<h2>Other Modes to Run the Application</h2>
   
Above we assume that the Flash application is being served by a web server, either remotely 
or locally. The latter is useful e.g. for testing and debugging

<p>There are two other modes for running a Flash application. The first one is to 
run the application with a stand
alone Flash player. However, as explained above, to use FlashLogger requires the application
to be embedded in an HTML, using some bits of JavaScript. A stand alone Flash player 
does not understand HTML nor JavaScript. So, this does not work.

<p>The second mode is to just drag the embedding HTML to the browser. FlashLogger
can work in this mode, however the application itself may not fully work in this mode.
E.g if the application loads images from files, the browser may block them for security reasons.

<p>Regardless which mode you choose, when debugging the Flash application, you may want to use the debugger version of the 
Flash player to be plugged in your browser. This version of player can produce its own log.
Using the trace(s) method programmers can write debugging information into this log. The 
FlashLogger also writes some debugging information to it. Check out e.g. the download site
of Adobe to download a debugger version of the Flash player. Check the documentation
<a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=logging_04.html">here</a>,
about how to enable Flash's native logging.


<br>
<h2>Example</h2>
   
A worked out example of customizing and deploying the logger is
provided in ./example. To build it, go to the folder, and run
make. You then need to deploy the directory to be served by a web
server. Two pages are provided:

<ol>
<li>flexstore_O.html, which will load the original Flash application, without the logger.
<li>flexstore_A.html, which will load the original Flash application, with the logger attached to it.
</ol>
